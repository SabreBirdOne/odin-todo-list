Your todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos. 
When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of ‘default’ project 
to which all of their todos are put. 
Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.

class Project: // Responsibility: store an array of ToDoItem objects
    String name,
    Array toDoItems,
