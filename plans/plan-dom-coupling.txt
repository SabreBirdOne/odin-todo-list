As this point, I know Project class contains an array of ToDoItem objects.

    Project 
        |
    contains
        |
    ToDoItem

I'm planning on ProjectCards containing ToDoItemCards. 
The card objects manipulate the DOM:

    AllProjectsDiv
        |
    contains
        |
    ProjectCards
        |
    contains
        |
    ToDoItemCards

So I end up with this coupling diagram:

                            AllProjectsDiv
                                |
                            contains
                                |
    Project  ---- ID ----   ProjectCards
        |                       |
    contains                contains
        |                       |
    ToDoItem ---- ID ----   ToDoItemCards

The tightest coupling is between the item and its card. 
For example, if Project needs a new property that needs to be seen 
on the DOM, both Project and Project Card must be updated.

The containing relationship isn't as tightly coupled. ToDoItem won't be 
affected too much by changes to the Project class. 

The left side is what will be the stored data.

The Cards will have functions (if necessary) to: 
- Create contained cards and items
- Read data from items 
- Update the data of the item
- Delete the item, containing cards and itself
Cards can find its item using the unique ID in both the item and its card.

No functions needed in the stored data, only in the Cards.

Updated diagram: 

                            AllProjectsDiv
                            (not implemeneted)
                                |
                            contains
                                |
    Project  ---- ID ----   ProjectCards 
        |                   (not implemented)
        |                       |
    contains                knows
        |                       |
                                V
    ToDoItem <-- knows --   ToDoItemCards

Major Update: 
When implementing Project Cards, I faced a decision: 
Do I contain the ToDoItemCard objects, or just append the divs inside 
each card into the project card div? 

So I decided that the Cards as JS objects shouldn't have to exist. 
The cards are already part of the DOM. 

What I really need are modules that manipulate the DOM, 
not objects to represent them. 

So now, I'm salvaging the ToDoItemCard class, and abandon the 
ProjectCard class. 

Program Flow:
Initial page load > managers > create/update data > update Cards
Button presses on cards > managers > data > update Cards

Updated diagram: 

    Project  <---\
        |         \               
    contains       +--->  Bunch of bundles idk <---> DOM
        |         /
    ToDoItem <---/

Data objects and DOM elements find each other with app-wide unique IDs.

So, what's going to be inside this bunch of bundles?
- card factories: 
    they don't make Card objects, they make divs as "cards" and return them. 
    something else will populate the data into these cards.
