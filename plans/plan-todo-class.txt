Your ‘todos’ are going to be objects that you’ll want to dynamically create, 
which means either using factories or constructors/classes to generate them.
Brainstorm what kind of properties your todo-items are going to have. 
At a minimum they should have a title, description, dueDate and priority. 
You might also want to include notes or even a checklist.

class ToDoItem: // Responsibility: store a todo-item's data.
    String title, 
    String description, 
    Date dueDate,
    Number priority (smaller is higher priority)
    
    String notes,
    Object checklist: String checklist item: Boolean completed

    String id: unique toDoItem identifier
